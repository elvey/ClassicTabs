See [the ClassicTabs extension page at opera.com](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/classic-tabs/) for more information, screenshots, installation, and feedback from users.

Please use the [issues tab](https://github.com/ChaosinaCan/ClassicTabs/issues) above if you find a problem. I do get notified when an issue is filed on Opera's addons page, but GitHub's issues are easier for me to use.
